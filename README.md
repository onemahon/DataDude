## Overview

Here's a project where I'll be dumping some examples and tool kits for dealing with data management on Android projects.

Data management is one of the most important functions of a mobile app. Unfortunately, there are tons of ways to execute it. My goal with this is to demonstrate some methodologies that increase efficiency and data safety throughout diverse kinds of projects.
